Matlab simulation of a two cell and three cell cascading H bridges with 2d and 3d feed forward modulation

Based on:
* Two-Dimensional Modulation Technique with DC Voltage Control for Single-Phase Two-Cell Cascaded Converters by Jose I. Leon, Sergio Vazquez, Ramon Portillo, Leopoldo G. Franquelo and Eugenio Dominguez
* Multidimensional Modulation Technique for Cascaded Multilevel Converters by Jose Ignacio Leon, Samir Kouro, Sergio Vazquez, Ramon Portillo, Leopoldo Garcia Franquelo, Juan Manuel Carrasco, and Jose Rodriguez

This is what I developed in a group project. For a paper with the complete results, email me.
